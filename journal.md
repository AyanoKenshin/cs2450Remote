Date: 1.25.26 - Subject: Setting Up Git and SSH Keys

I was confused since I have never set up an ssh key before and I have barely used wsl so it took a while but 
I figured it out I think. I kept getting messages that did not follow with the instructions so I had to look 
elsewhere for help but I think I am back on the right track.
